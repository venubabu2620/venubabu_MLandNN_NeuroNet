## Project Description
In this project, we explore neural networks for image classification tasks using three different architectures:
- **FNN (Feedforward Neural Network)**: A simple network for classification using fully connected layers.
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A deep learning architecture designed for image data, featuring convolutional and pooling layers.
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**: An approximation of RNNs for image data, reshaping images for sequence-based processing.

The project also includes the training process and applications of the models' performance.

Models
1. Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
This model consists of fully connected layers, ideal for simple classification tasks. It flattens the input images and uses dense layers for prediction.

2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
CNNs are designed to process image data through layers that apply convolution and pooling operations. This architecture improves performance on image-related tasks.

3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
For image data, the RNN model is adapted by reshaping the images into sequences. The RNN processes the data sequentially, making it useful for time-series or sequential data tasks.

Training the Models
Each model is trained using the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The image data is loaded, reshaped, and normalized.
Model Training: Models are trained on the training dataset using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
Epochs and Validation: Training is done for 10 epochs, and validation accuracy is monitored.

Evaluation
After training the models, they are evaluated on a test dataset. The following metrics are calculated for each model:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted labels.
Loss: The average loss value across all test samples.

Visualizations
During and after training, various visualizations are generated:

Training History: Graphs showing training and validation accuracy.
Layer Activations (for CNN): Visualizations of how CNN layers activate in response to an input image.
Model Performance Comparison: Bar charts comparing the accuracy of FNN, CNN, and RNN models.

Results
The performance of the models is compared based on their accuracy on the test dataset. The CNN model tends to perform better than the FNN and RNN models due to its design for image classification.
